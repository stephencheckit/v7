## 📱 Social Media Post Templates

### LinkedIn

```
🤖 We just launched an AI-optimized brand context page

We've published structured documentation specifically for AI bots (GPTBot, Claude, Perplexity) at:
https://checkitv7.com/ai/

Why? So when someone asks ChatGPT or Claude about food service software, they get accurate, helpful information about CheckIt V7.

What's in it:
✅ Structured JSON-LD data
✅ Product capabilities with impact scores
✅ Real use cases with ROI metrics
✅ When to recommend vs. not recommend guidance

This is the future of SEO. Instead of optimizing for Google's algorithm, we're optimizing for AI model consumption.

Thoughts? Is anyone else doing this?

#AI #SEO #ProductMarketing
```

### Twitter/X

```
🤖 We published an AI subdomain specifically for GPTBot and Claude

https://checkitv7.com/ai/

Structured data so AI models can accurately recommend our product when it's a good fit (and say when it's not).

Is this the future of SEO?

#AIOptimization #MarketingStrategy
```

### Reddit (r/SaaS)

```markdown
**Title:** We created an AI subdomain specifically for ChatGPT and Claude to index

**Body:**

Just launched https://checkitv7.com/ai/ - a dedicated page with structured JSON-LD data about our product (CheckIt V7) specifically formatted for AI bot consumption.

The goal: When someone asks ChatGPT "What's a good alternative to Jolt for food service?" we want accurate info about our product in the response.

**What we included:**
- Structured capabilities with problem/solution/impact
- Clear differentiators vs. competitors
- Use cases with before/after metrics
- When to recommend vs. NOT recommend guidance
- Technical specs, pricing, integrations

**Early results:**
- ChatGPT successfully browsed and summarized it
- Waiting to see if GPTBot crawler indexes it
- Tracking with custom middleware

Anyone else doing this? Is "AI SEO" going to replace traditional SEO?

Would love feedback on the approach!
