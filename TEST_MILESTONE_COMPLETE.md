## 🔧 Testing Infrastructure

### Tools
- **Framework**: Vitest 4.0.4
- **Environment**: Node.js + JSDOM
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Vercel
- **Pre-commit**: Husky hooks
- **Configuration**: vitest.config.mjs

### Commands
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
npm run test:ui       # Visual UI
npm run deploy        # Tests + Deploy
```

### Triple Safety Gates
1. **Local Pre-commit**: Husky runs tests before commit
2. **GitHub Actions**: Tests on every push
3. **Vercel Build**: Tests before deployment
