## Troubleshooting

### "Printer not connecting to WiFi"
- Check WiFi password is correct
- Ensure 2.4GHz network (printer may not support 5GHz)
- Printer must be within range of WiFi router
- Some corporate WiFi networks block device connections (try guest network)

### "Printer doesn't show up in macOS"
- Print network config: Should show `Wireless Status: Connected`
- Verify IP address is on same subnet as your Mac (e.g., both 192.168.1.x)
- Try adding manually: IP tab â†’ Enter IP â†’ Protocol: Line Printer Daemon - LPD

### "Bridge doesn't detect printer"
- Run: `lpstat -p | grep -i zebra` (should show printer name)
- If nothing, printer isn't added to macOS yet
- Remove and re-add printer in System Settings

---

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Check if macOS sees the printer
lpstat -p | grep -i zebra

# Check printer connection details
lpstat -v | grep -i zebra

# Send test print manually
echo "^XA^FO50,50^A0N,50,50^FDTest Print^FS^XZ" | lp -d [printer-name] -o raw
```
