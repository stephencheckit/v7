## 🔄 User Flow

### Happy Path
```
1. User clicks "Forgot password?" on sign-in page
   └─> Redirects to /forgot-password

2. User enters email address
   └─> Supabase sends reset email (valid for 1 hour)

3. User clicks link in email
   └─> Redirects to /reset-password with session token

4. User enters new password (twice for confirmation)
   └─> Password updated in Supabase

   └─> User signs in with new password
```

### Edge Cases Handled
