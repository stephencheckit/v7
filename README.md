## 🎨 What We're Building

### The Vision
A form builder where users have a conversation with AI to create forms:

```
User: "Create a contact form with name, email, and message"

AI: ✓ Creating contact form...
    ✓ Added name field (text input)
    ✓ Added email field (with validation)
    ✓ Added message field (textarea)
    ✓ Form ready!

[Live form preview appears in real-time →]
```

### Key Features
- 🎯 **Natural Language Creation** - Describe forms, AI builds them
- ⚡ **Real-Time Streaming** - Cursor-like UX, see forms build live
- 🎨 **13+ Field Types** - Text, email, date, file upload, choices, etc.
- ✅ **Smart Validation** - AI adds appropriate validation rules
- 📦 **Export Anywhere** - React components, JSON, HTML, embed codes
- 🔧 **Developer-Friendly** - API-first, extensible architecture
