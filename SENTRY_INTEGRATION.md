## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Create Sentry Account
Go to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/) and create a free account

### 2. Create Project
- Select **Next.js** as your platform
- Copy your **DSN** (looks like: `https://abc123@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/7654321`)

### 3. Add Environment Variable
Create `.env.local` in project root:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
```

That's it! Sentry is now tracking errors.

## ✨ What You Get Automatically

### ✅ Already Working
- **Client-side error tracking** - JavaScript errors in browser
- **Server-side error tracking** - API route errors
- **React error boundaries** - Component crash protection
- **User context** - Knows which user had the error
- **Workspace context** - Tracks which workspace
- **Friendly error UI** - Shows users a nice error page
- **Session replay on errors** - See what user did before crash
- **Performance monitoring** - Track slow requests (optional)

### 🎯 Error Context Captured
When an error occurs, Sentry automatically captures:
- User ID and email
- Workspace ID
- URL and route
- Browser/device info
- React component stack
- User actions (breadcrumbs)
- Network requests

---

## 🧪 Test It Works

### Method 1: Add Test Button
Add this anywhere in your app:
```typescript
<button onClick={() => { throw new Error("Test Sentry!"); }}>
  Test Error
</button>
```

### Method 2: Trigger Console Error
Open browser console and type:
```javascript
throw new Error("Testing Sentry from console!");
```

Check your Sentry dashboard - you should see the error within seconds!

## 📊 Features Configured

### ✅ Session Replay (On Errors Only)
- Records user session when error occurs
- See what happened before the crash
- Privacy-safe (text/media masked by default)
- Only records 10% of sessions, but 100% on errors

### ✅ Performance Monitoring
- Tracks page load times
- Monitors API response times
- Currently set to 100% sample rate (good for dev)
- Reduce to 10% in production to save quota

### ✅ Error Boundaries
All pages are wrapped with ErrorBoundary component:
- Catches React component crashes
- Shows friendly error UI
- Allows user to refresh or go home
- Sends full stack trace to Sentry

### ✅ User Context
Automatically tracks:
- User ID (from Supabase)
- Email address
- Username (derived from email)
- Workspace ID
- Cleared on sign-out

---

## 💰 Free Tier Limits

- **5,000 errors/month** - Plenty for early stage
- **1 user** included
- **90 days** data retention
- Unlimited projects
- Performance monitoring (limited transactions)
- Session replays (limited)

**Cost:** $0/month initially. You'll know when you need to upgrade.

---

## 🎛️ Configuration

### Adjust Sample Rates (Production)
Edit `sentry.client.config.ts`:
```typescript
tracesSampleRate: 0.1,  // Sample 10% of transactions (save quota)
replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1, // Sample 10% of sessions
replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0, // Always record when error occurs
```

### Ignore Certain Errors
```typescript
Sentry.init({
  ignoreErrors: [
    'ResizeObserver loop limit exceeded',
    'Non-Error promise rejection captured',
  ],
});
```

### Add Tags to Errors
```typescript
Sentry.setTag('feature', 'sensors');
Sentry.setTag('environment', 'production');
```

---

## 🔔 Alerts (Recommended Setup)

1. Go to Sentry → **Alerts**
2. Create alert: "New error occurs"
3. Connect to:
   - Email
   - Slack (recommended)
   - Discord
   - PagerDuty

Get notified instantly when errors happen!

---

## 📖 Next Steps

1. ✅ Create Sentry account
2. ✅ Add DSN to `.env.local`
3. ✅ Test error tracking works
4. ⬜ Set up Slack/email alerts
5. ⬜ Configure for production (lower sample rates)
6. ⬜ Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` (should already be there)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Errors Not Showing Up?
1. Check `.env.local` has correct DSN
2. Restart dev server (`npm run dev`)
3. Check Sentry DSN is `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` (public prefix required)
4. Look for Sentry init logs in browser console

### Too Many Errors?
1. Add common false positives to `ignoreErrors`
2. Lower sample rates in production
3. Use `beforeSend` to filter errors

### Need Help?

## 🎉 Summary

Sentry is fully integrated and ready to use! Just add your DSN and you're tracking errors in production. No more guessing what went wrong - you'll see exactly what happened, who it affected, and where in your code the error occurred.

**Your users will thank you for catching errors before they report them!** 🚀
