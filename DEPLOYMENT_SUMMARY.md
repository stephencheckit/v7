# Domain Intelligence Onboarding - Deployment Summary

## ✅ Build Complete!

The domain intelligence onboarding system has been fully implemented and is ready for testing.

## What Was Built

### 🗄️ Database Layer
- **Migration:** `supabase/migrations/20251024200000_add_workspace_intelligence.sql`
  - Added `intelligence_data` (jsonb) to workspaces
  - Added `company_name` (text) to workspaces

  - Supports: Fast-Casual, Fine-Dining, Healthcare, Corporate
  - Creates 8-12 fields per form with validation rules

### 🔌 API Routes
- **POST /api/onboarding/intelligence**
  - Extracts business data from email domain
  - Uses Anthropic Claude API
  - Stores results in workspace
  - Skips consumer domains (gmail, yahoo, etc.)

- **POST /api/onboarding/populate**
  - Bulk inserts food items from intelligence data
  - Generates custom form templates
  - Returns counts of items created

### 🎨 User Interface

  - Two-option choice screen
  - "Start Fresh" vs "Smart Setup"
  - Clear time expectations
  - Recommended badge on Smart Setup

- **Processing Page:** `/onboarding/processing`
  - Animated loading stages
  - Real-time progress messages
  - Results summary
  - Auto-redirect to dashboard

- **Dashboard Enhancement:**
  - Welcome card for onboarded users

## 📋 Before Testing

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Option A: Via Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option B: Via Supabase Dashboard
# Go to SQL Editor and run the migration file manually
```

### 2. Set Environment Variable

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Get API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/

### 3. Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Business Email Onboarding

1. **Sign up with business email:**
   ```
   Email: test@yourbusiness.com (use a real business domain)
   Password: test123
   ```

2. **Confirm email** via link sent by Supabase

3. **Should redirect to** `/onboarding/welcome`

4. **Click "Personalize My Workspace"**

5. **Wait 30-60 seconds** - should show progress messages

6. **Verify results:**
   - Dashboard shows welcome card
   - Card shows count of food items and forms
   - Click "View Menu Items" → see items with ✨ badge
   - Click "View Forms" → see 3 auto-generated forms

### Test 2: Consumer Email (Skip Onboarding)

1. **Sign up with:** `test@gmail.com`

2. **Confirm email**

3. **Should go directly to** `/dashboard` (no onboarding)

4. **Verify:** No welcome card, empty workspace

### Test 3: Start Fresh Option

1. **Sign up with business email**

2. **At welcome screen, click "Get Started"** (Start Fresh option)

3. **Should go to** `/dashboard` immediately

4. **Verify:** Empty workspace, no pre-loaded data

### Test 4: Cancel Processing

1. **Start Smart Setup**

2. **Click "Cancel and start fresh"** during processing

3. **Should redirect to** `/dashboard`

4. **Verify:** No data imported

## 🔍 Verification Queries

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check workspace was updated
SELECT 
  id,
  company_name,
  onboarding_completed,
  intelligence_data->>'business_type' as business_type,
  intelligence_data->>'location_count' as locations,
  onboarding_completed_at
FROM workspaces
WHERE onboarding_completed = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check food items were imported
SELECT 
  name,
  category,
  shelf_life_days,
  allergens,
  source_type,
  created_at
FROM food_items
WHERE source_type = 'domain_intelligence'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check forms were generated
SELECT 
  title,
  description,
  template_category,
  jsonb_array_length(fields) as field_count,
  created_at
FROM forms
WHERE template_category = 'onboarding_generated'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to collect intelligence"

**Possible causes:**
- Anthropic API key not set
- API key invalid or expired
- Rate limit exceeded

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify API key in .env.local
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Test API key
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022","max_tokens":1024,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"test"}]}'
```

### Processing Never Completes

**Possible causes:**
- AI API timeout
- Domain has no public information
- Database insert failed

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Check server logs: `npm run dev` output
- Test API directly: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/onboarding/intelligence -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"test@example.com","workspace_id":"uuid","user_id":"uuid"}'`

### Dashboard Doesn't Show Welcome Card

**Possible causes:**
- `onboarding_completed` not set to true
- No items imported (check food_items count)
- Cache issue

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Force set onboarding_completed
UPDATE workspaces
SET onboarding_completed = true
WHERE owner_id = 'your_user_id';
```

### No Forms Generated

**Possible causes:**
- business_type not recognized
- Form generator error

**Solution:**
- Check intelligence_data JSON structure
- Verify business_type is one of: restaurant, cafe, catering, healthcare, corporate
- Check server logs for form generation errors

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Testing with Real Businesses

Use real business domains for accurate results:
- ✅ `test@chipotle.com`
- ✅ `test@marriott.com`
- ✅ `test@wholefoods.com`
- ❌ `test@fakebusiness123.com` (won't have data)

### AI Prompt Tuning

If results are inconsistent, adjust the prompt in:
`app/api/onboarding/intelligence/route.ts`

Make it more specific:
- Request exact format
- Add examples
- Specify data quality requirements

### Cost Management

To reduce API costs:
- Lower max_tokens from 4096 to 2048
- Request fewer menu items (max 25 instead of 50)
- Cache results for common domains
