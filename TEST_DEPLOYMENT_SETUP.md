### 3. Deployment Pipeline

#### GitHub Actions
- ✅ **test.yml** - Runs on every push/PR
- ✅ **deploy.yml** - Runs before production deploy
- ✅ Automatic build verification
- ✅ Multi-gate safety system

#### Pre-Deploy Hooks
- ✅ **npm run deploy** - Tests before pushing
- ✅ **predeploy script** - Auto-runs tests
- ✅ **Husky pre-commit** - Optional hook setup

#### Vercel Integration
- ✅ Auto-deploy after tests pass
- ✅ Preview deployments for PRs
- ✅ Production protected by CI

## 🚀 How to Use

### Daily Development
```bash
# Watch mode (auto-run on changes)
npm run test:watch

# Quick test before commit
npm test
```

### Deploying
```bash
# RECOMMENDED: Test then deploy
npm run deploy

# Or manually
npm test
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```

### What Happens
1. **Local**: Tests run on your machine
2. **GitHub**: Actions runs tests again  
3. **Vercel**: Deploys only if tests pass

**Result**: Zero broken deploys! 🎯

## 🎯 Safety Gates

### Gate 1: Local Machine
```bash
npm run deploy
  ↓
Runs npm test
  ↓
If pass → git push
If fail → Deploy aborted ✋
```

### Gate 2: GitHub Actions
```
Push to GitHub
  ↓
GitHub Actions runs tests
  ↓
If pass → Continue
If fail → No deployment ✋
```

### Gate 3: Vercel
```
Tests passed on GitHub
  ↓
Vercel starts deployment
  ↓
Production updated ✅
```

**Triple protection** = Near-zero chance of broken code in production!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### During Development
```bash
# Keep tests running while you code
npm run test:watch
```

### Before Committing
```bash
# Quick check
npm test
```

### Before Deploying
```bash
# Safest way
npm run deploy
```

### Debugging Tests
```bash
# Visual UI
npm run test:ui
```

## 🚨 Common Questions

### Q: Do I have to run tests every time?
**A**: The `npm run deploy` command does it automatically. Or GitHub Actions will catch failures.

### Q: What if I need to deploy urgently?
**A**: Use `git push` directly. Tests still run on GitHub, but you skip local check.

### Q: What if tests are slow?
**A**: Currently 300ms (very fast!). We'll optimize if it gets >1s.

### Q: Can I skip tests sometimes?
**A**: `git commit --no-verify` skips hooks, but **not recommended**.

### Q: How do I add new tests?
**A**: See `TESTING.md` for examples and patterns.
